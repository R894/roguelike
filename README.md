# Roguelike
A roguelike game developed in Rust using the Bevy game engine.

# Overview
This project serves as a learning experience for both [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). The game implements classic roguelike mechanics such as procedural dungeon generation, tile-based movement, and line-of-sight visibility.
